# Portfolio
Portfolio is a sleek showcase of a web developer's skills and projects. Includes a home section, an about me section detailing career goals, and a projects section highlighting key achievements. The contact form allows users to submit feedback, with data stored in a MySQL database. Clean design and clear navigation enhance the user experience.
